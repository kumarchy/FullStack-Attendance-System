## 🌟 Overview

This project is a state-of-the-art, full-stack face recognition attendance system that integrates cutting-edge AI technology with modern web development practices. It provides a seamless, automated solution for tracking attendance in educational institutions or corporate environments.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face recognition using OpenCV and dlib's ResNet model
- User-friendly React.js frontend with live video feed
- Intuitive interface for student registration and data management
- Node.js backend with Python integration for AI processing
- MongoDB database for efficient data storage and retrieval
- Automated daily attendance tracking 
- Scalable architecture to handle multiple simultaneous users

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, Axios
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Python
- AI/ML: OpenCV, dlib ResNet, NumPy, scikit-image
- Database: MongoDB

## 🏗 Architecture

1. Frontend: React.js application with components for video capture, user registration, and attendance management.
2. Backend:
  - Node.js/Express.js server handling API requests and serving the React app.
  - Python scripts for face recognition and model training, integrated with Node.js.
3. Database: MongoDB for storing student information and attendance records.
4. AI Processing: OpenCV and dlib for face detection and recognition.

## 🛠 Setup and Installation

- Clone the repository:
  ``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git

- Install dependencies:
  ``` bash
  cd face-recognition-attendance
  npm install
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- Set up MongoDB and update the connection string in server.js.
- Start the server:
  ``` bash
  npm start
- In a new terminal, start the React app:
  ``` bash
  cd client
  npm start

## 📘 Usage
1. Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
2. Use the "Training" section to register new students:

  - Enter name and roll number
  - Capture images using the webcam
3. Train the model using the "Train" button.
4. Use the "Take Attendance" button to start the attendance process.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

- POST /collect_images: Upload student images for training
- POST /train_model: Train the face recognition model
- POST /take_attendance: Initiate the attendance taking process

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Implement liveness detection to prevent spoofing
- Develop a mobile app for on-the-go attendance marking
- Optimize for large-scale deployments with load balancing
- Integrate with existing school/corporate management systems
- Implement data analytics for attendance trend analysis
